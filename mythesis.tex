Myrna Ivelisse Merced Serrano was born and raise at the southeast of the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Myrna is an athletic girl, her favorite sport is basketball and at her free time she like to go out with her friends, cook, and watch television. 

She did her Bachelors degree in Computational Mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao. While during her bachelors degree she became interesting on computers and programming. She went beyond most of the students of her class by gaining interest in research. She wanted to mix nanotechnology with biology, somehow. Therefore, she did studies on molecular dynamic simulations between carbon nanotubes and single-stranded DNA. Doing research motivates her to go beyond her current goal, that is why she decided to do graduate studies in a college in the United States. Although, she had to be far from her family to achieve her goals.

In August 2009 she started her graduate studies in the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University. She worked as a teaching assistant while she was there, and she enjoys the satisfaction of helping other students to improve their knowledge.
