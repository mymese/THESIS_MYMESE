\begin{dedication}
I would like to dedicate this thesis to my family, particularly the Merced-Serrano, the Merced-Hern\'{a}ndez, the Figueroa-Vel\'{a}zquez, the Espinosa-Huertas, and the Cintr\'{o}n-Andino families. I love you all and I dedicate you all my effort and the commitment I made during this journey. Also, I have reached this goal for personal satisfaction and for you all. Thanks for your unconditional love, comprehension, and support. 

Also, I would like to dedicate this thesis to my beautiful goddaughter Keilyane Naomi and my gorgeous godson Angel Daniel.

\begin{acknowledgments}
I would like to acknowledge my advisor Dr. Gordon Erlebacher for motivating me to work harder everyday. His advice has made me a better person and a better student. Also, I would like to give a special recognition to my colleague Ian Johnson, thanks for your guidance during this project and for your availability for assisting me. I would also like to thank Evan Bollig and Andrew Young for your help in the course of this project. Last but not least, I would like to thanks the graduate students from the Department of Scientific Computing, faculty and staff for their support.

\begin{abstract} 
In this thesis, we discuss the development of a new Boids system that simulates flocking behavior, inside the Blender Game Engine, and within the framework of the Real-Time Particles System (RTPS) library developed by Ian Johnson. The collective behavior of Boids is characterized as an emergent behavior caused by following three steering behaviors: \textit{separation}, \textit{alignment}, and \textit{cohesion}. The implementation leverages the latest OpenCL to maintain the portability of the Blender across different operating systems. Benchmarks of the RTPS-FLOCK system show that our implementation speeds up Blender's original Boids implementation (which cannot run in the game engine) by more than an order of magnitude. We illustrate our boids system with three demonstrations. The first demo shows the symmetry that each steering behavior maintains. The second demonstration illustrates the behavior of a  swarm of bees approaching their hive, and the last demo illustrates a simulation of a crowd constrained to a two-dimensional plane.

Myrna Ivelisse Merced Serrano was born and raised at the southeast of the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Myrna is athletic, her favorite sport is basketball and during her free time, she likes to go out with her friends, and cook. 

She completed her bachelors degree in Computational Mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao. During her bachelors degree, Merced Serrano became interested on computers and programming. Going beyond most of the students of her class, she developed interest in research wanting to combine nanotechnology with biology. This led to studies on molecular dynamic simulations between carbon nanotubes and single-stranded DNA. Pursuing research motivated her to further her goals, which is why she decided to enroll for graduate studies in a college in the United States, even though it meant moving far from her family.

In August 2009 Merced Serrano joined the Department of Scientific Computing (DSC) at Florida State University. She worked there as a teaching assistant, and enjoyed the satisfaction of helping other students to enhance their knowledge. The research presented in this thesis was completed while as a graduate student in DSC.
