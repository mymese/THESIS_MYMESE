\section{Introduction}

Video games have been around since the 1950s\cite{computerVideoGamesHistory}. They became available in the market by the 1970s, at that time they were very popular. Currently, games are the attraction of too many people. They are all kinds of game available now. They are consoles games, portable games, computer games, cell phone games; games are everywhere. 

Our intention is to create tools that helps to create games but not any kind of games, we focus in \textit{educational games}. Educational games are the games that not only the player enjoy while he/she is playing moreover the player also learn playing it. Therefore we chose \textit{Blender} as the software to enhance in this project. We would be working on it \textit{Game Engine} which lacks of Particle Systems.
